## Test environments

* R 3.6.3 on local Ubuntu 19.10 system (platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit))
* R 3.6.3 on local Windows 10 x64 (build 18363) system (platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit))
* Travis CI
* win-builder (R-devel and R-release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs in a local R CMD check. Please note however that this is my first submission. I guess this is the reason why win-builder gives 1 NOTE.

## Downstream dependencies

There are no packages depending on **shinybrms**.
