```

The following screenshots show how to fit an example model in the **shinybrms** app. For instructions how to launch the **shinybrms** app, see the [starting page](../index.html).

## Data

Usually, you will want to upload a custom dataset, but for the purpose of demonstration, we will choose the example dataset `MASS::bacteria` here:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_1.png")
```
[![](screenshots/small/bacteria_1.png)](screenshots/bacteria_1.png)
*Fig. 1: Page "Data" (top).*

Here, we have chosen to show all rows of the dataset (option visible when scrolling down):

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_2.png")
```
[![](screenshots/small/bacteria_2.png)](screenshots/bacteria_2.png)
*Fig. 2: Page "Data" (bottom).*

## Likelihood

### Outcome

On page "Likelihood", the first tab is "Outcome". Here, we define the variable `y` (from our dataset `MASS::bacteria`) to be the outcome and since this is a binary outcome, we choose the distributional family "Bernoulli with logit link":

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_3.png")
```

*Fig. 3: Page "Likelihood", tab "Outcome".*

### Predictors

After selecting the tab "Predictors", we define `week` and `trt` to have nonvarying main effects and `ID` to have varying intercepts:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_4.png")
```
[![](screenshots/small/bacteria_4.png)](screenshots/bacteria_4.png)
*Fig. 4: Page "Likelihood", tab "Predictors" (top).*

After scrolling down, we define `week` and `trt` to have a (nonvarying) interaction effect:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_5.png")
```
[![](screenshots/small/bacteria_5.png)](screenshots/bacteria_5.png)
*Fig. 5: Page "Likelihood", tab "Predictors" (bottom; setting up the interaction effect).*

After clicking on "Add interaction term", we get:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_6.png")
```

*Fig. 6: Page "Likelihood", tab "Predictors" (bottom; after adding the interaction effect).*

## Prior

### Default priors

At the top of page "Prior", we get a table with the default priors for the model we have specified so far:

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_7.png")
```
[![](screenshots/small/bacteria_7.png)](screenshots/bacteria_7.png)
*Fig. 7: Page "Prior" (top).*

At the bottom of page "Prior", we can specify custom priors. Here, we will use a Student-$t$ prior distribution with 3 degrees of freedom, a location parameter of 0, and a scale parameter of 10 for all regression coefficients (class `b`):

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_8.png")
```
[![](screenshots/small/bacteria_8.png)](screenshots/bacteria_8.png)
*Fig. 8: Page "Prior" (bottom; setting up a custom prior).*

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/bacteria_9.png")
```

*Fig. 9: Page "Prior" (bottom; after adding a custom prior).*
